# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Project Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all the spaces are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Technologies Used

* HTML: To create the structure of the game board and interface.
* CSS: To style the game board and interface.
* JavaScript: To implement the game logic and interactivity.

## Game Logic

1. Players: There are two players in the game, X and O.
2. Turns: Players take turns to place their token (X or O) on the 3x3 grid.
3. Win Condition: A player wins if they place three of their tokens in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
4. Tie Condition: If all the boxes are filled and no player has three tokens in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Future Enhancements

* Add a restart button to reset the game without refreshing the page.
* Improve the UI with animations and better styling.
* Add a scoreboard to keep track of wins and ties.
